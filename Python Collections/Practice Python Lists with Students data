Ques:1
Assume that you are compiling a list of mathematical constants, and you decide to represent all of them in a Python list, following this structure:
maths_constants = [['name of constant', 'numeric value'],
                   ['name of constant', 'numeric value'],
                   ['name of constant', 'numeric value'],
                   ...
                ]
As exemplified in the list maths_constants. However, upon review, you realize that you missed the value of Pi.
Let's address this by first identifying its prospective index if it were included in the list, considering the alternating pattern of string constants and their numeric values.
Store the index in the variable index_pi.
Ans:
  index_pi = maths_constants.index(['Pi'])
  The method .index will search for the item Pi in our list and provide its index.


Ques:2
As you have found the index of the Pi, now you have to insert the value after the name Pi in the list.
Your final complete list of mathematical constants including the value of Pi should be in the variable maths_constants.
Input the value of Pi as 3.1416(in float)
Ans:  
  We have calculated the index of the Pi in the previous activity. Now we will use the method .insert() to insert the value of the Pi in the list.
  maths_constants[index_pi].insert(1, 3.1416)
  Here we have used the method .insert() to insert the value of the Pi in the list. 
  The method .insert() takes two arguments, the first argument is the index where we want to insert the value and the second argument is the value we want to insert.


Ques:3
Add all the characters of our even_string to the end of our list odd_list.
[!] Important:
Do Not Use Loops and if else statements.
Add each character of the string, not the whole string.
After extending, the final result will be: [99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, '2', '4', '6', '8', '9']
Ans:
  odd_list.extend(even_string)
  odd_list
  The .extend method takes an iterable (another list, tuple, string, set) and adds its individual elements to the list on which it is applied. 
  So, in our solution, the odd_list is extended with each character from the even_string string.
