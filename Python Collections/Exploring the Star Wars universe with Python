Ques:1
Input the number of characters in the dataset.
Ans:
  len(dataset)


Ques:2
You should create a dictionary eye_color with the colors as keys and their counts as values. Counts are the number of characters with that eye color.
Expected output should be a dictionary with keys as colors and values as counts.
{'brown': 3,
 'blue-gray': 1,
 'blue': 6,
 'yellow': 2,
 'red': 2,
 'black': 1,
 'orange': 1}
Ans:
  eye_color = {}
  for character in dataset:
      eye_color.setdefault(character["eye_color"], 0)
      eye_color[character["eye_color"]] += 1
  eye_color
  In the above code, we are using the setdefault method to set the default value of the key to 0 if it doesn't exist. Then we are incrementing the value by 1.


Ques:3
Please format the input as follows: 'brown': 6. Pay attention to the correct use of spaces and symbols.
Ans:
  eye_color = {}
  for character in dataset:
      eye_color.setdefault(character["eye_color"], 0)
      eye_color[character["eye_color"]] += 1
  max(eye_color.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
  In the above code, we are using the max function to find the maximum value in the dictionary. The max function takes two arguments: the first is the dictionary, and the second is a function that returns the value
  to be compared. In this case, we are using a lambda function to return the value of the dictionary item.
  If you don't know about lambda functions, you can follow below basic iteration solution:
  eye_color = {}
  for character in dataset:
      eye_color.setdefault(character["eye_color"], 0)
      eye_color[character["eye_color"]] += 1
  max_value = 0
  max_key = None
  for key, value in eye_color.items():
      if value > max_value:
          max_value = value
          max_key = key
  print(max_key, max_value)


Ques:4
How many female characters are listed?
Please input an integer value.
Ans:
  count = 0
  for character in dataset:
      if character["gender"] == "female":
          count += 1
  count


Ques:5
Average height of all the character will be the sum of all character heights divided by the number of characters.
Convert the individual character height to float before calculating the average.
Ans:
  count = len(dataset)
  sum_height = 0
  for character in dataset:
      sum_height += float(character["height"])
  sum_height / count
  In the above code, we are using the float function to convert the height string to a float value. Then we are adding the height to the sum_height variable. 
  Finally, we are dividing the sum by the number of characters to get the average height.


Ques:6
Create a set films_set and store all the films directed by 'George Lucas'.
Example of expected output:
{'The Phantom Menace','Attack of the Clones',...}
Ans:
  films_set = set()
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character["films"]:
          if film["director"] == "George Lucas":
              films_set.add(film["title"])
  films_set
  In this solution, we are using a nested loop to iterate over the films and check if the director is George Lucas. If the director is George Lucas, we are adding the film title to the films_set.


Ques:7
Count the number of films directed by George Lucas.
o 5
o 3
o 6
o 4
Ans:
  4


Ques:8
Input the name of the character with the highest weight.
There are some characters whose weight is 'unknown', and you have to ignore those characters.
Ans:
  max_weight = -1
  character_with_highest_weight = None
  for character in dataset:
      weight_str = character.get('mass')
      if weight_str.isnumeric():
          weight = int(weight_str)
          if weight > max_weight:
              max_weight = weight
              character_with_highest_weight = character.get('name')
  print("The character with the highest weight is:", character_with_highest_weight)


Ques:9
Input the name of the character that is a dwarf. A dwarf is a character whose height is less than 100 cm. If there are multiple dwarfs, input the name of the character that has lowest height.
Ans:
  for character in dataset:
    height_str = character.get('height')
    if height_str.isnumeric():
        height = int(height_str)
        if height < 100:
            print("The dwarf is:", character.get('name'))


Ques:10
Input the total number of distinct films.
Ans:
  films_set = set()
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character["films"]:
          films_set.add(film["title"])
  len(films_set)
  In this solution, we are using a nested loop to iterate over the films and add the film title to the films_set. Then we are using the len function to find the number of films in the films_set.


Ques:11
Create a dictionary films_dict where the film's title will be the key and the list of producers as its values.
Example of expected output:
{'Black Bird':['Gary Kurtaz','Adult Smith'],
'Return of the Jedi': ['Howard G. Kazanjian','George Lucas','Rick McCallum'],
  ...
}
Ans:
  films_dict = {}
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character["films"]:
          producer = film["producer"]
          if len(producer) > 1:
              films_dict[film["title"]] = producer
  films_dict
  In the above code, we are using a nested loop to iterate over the films and check if the number of producers is greater than 1.
  If the number of producers is greater than 1, we are adding the film title and the list of producers to the films_dict.


Ques:12
Create a dictionary films_chron where the keys will be the datetime (from the datetime module) of the film and the values will be the titles of the films.
Example of expected output:
{ 
   datetime.datetime(1999, 5, 19, 0, 0): 'The Phantom Menace',
   datetime.datetime(2002, 5, 16, 0, 0): 'Attack of the Clones',
 ...
 }
Sort the films by date in ascending order.
Ans:
  from datetime import datetime
  films_chron = {}
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character['films']:
          date = datetime.strptime(film['release_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
          if date not in films_chron:
              films_chron[date] = film['title']
  # Updating the dictionary to sort the films by date
  films_chron = dict(sorted(films_chron.items(), key=lambda x: x[0]))
  In the above code, we are using the strptime function to convert the date string to a datetime object. Then we are adding the datetime object and the film title to the films_chron dictionary.


Ques:13
Create a list films containing the title of the films sorted in ascending lexicographical order (A>Z). films should contain distinct (or unique) values.
Example of expected output:
[
  "A New Hope",
  "Attack of the Clones",
  ...
  "The Phantom Menace"
]
Ans:
  A simple way would be build the list, but before adding a new film, checking if it's not already there:
  films = []
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character["films"]:
          if film["title"] not in films:
              films.append(film["title"])
  # Finally sort:
  films = sorted(films)
  Alternatively, we could use a set, to leverage its feature of "unique elements":
  films_set = set()
  for person in dataset:
      for film in person['films']:
          films_set.add(film['title'])
  films = sorted(films_set)


Ques:14
Create a dictionary characters_dict containing those characters that appeared in MORE than one film (ie: at least, 2 films).
The dictonary will map the name of the character to a list of all the films they participated in. Example:
Example of expected output:
{
    'Luke Skywalker': ['A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi'],
    'Han Solo': ['A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi'],
    'Darth Vader': ['A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi', 'Revenge of the Sith'],
    ...
}
Ans:
  characters_dict = {}
  for character in dataset:
      name = character["name"]
      if len(character['films']) <= 1:
          continue
      characters_dict[name] = []
      for film in character["films"]:
          characters_dict[name].append(film["title"])
  characters_dict


Ques:15
Create a list films_director where each element will be a tuple containing the film title and the director's name. The list should contain distinct values.

 ('Return of the Jedi', 'Richard Marquand'),
 ('The Phantom Menace', 'George Lucas'),
 ...
 ]
Ans:
  films_director = []
  for character in dataset:
      for film in character["films"]:
          if (film["title"], film["director"]) not in films_director:
              films_director.append((film["title"], film["director"]))
  films_director

 ...
 }
Ans:
  planets_set = set()
  for character in dataset:
      planet = character["homeworld"]
      planets_set.add((planet["name"], int(planet["diameter"])))
  planets_set


Ques:17
Create a set red_eyes_species that contains the names of the species with red eyes.
Here, we are considering the species associated with a character, and not a character itself.
If species has multiple eye colors, and one of them is red, then it should be included in the set.
Expected example of output:
{'Wookie',...}
Ans:
  red_eyes_species = set()
  for character in dataset:
      for specie in character["species"]:
          if "red" in specie["eye_colors"]:
              red_eyes_species.add(specie["name"])
  red_eyes_species


Ques:18
Create a dictionary called skin_color_character, which contains keys representing different skin colors and values as lists of names of characters who share the same skin color.

          if skin_color not in skin_color_character:
              skin_color_character[skin_color] = []
          skin_color_character[skin_color].append(character["name"])
  # Printing the result
  print(skin_color_character)

 'Rodia': {'Greedo'},
 'Nal Hutta': {'Jabba Desilijic Tiure'}}
Ans:
  from_planet = {}
  for character in dataset:
      hw = character["homeworld"]
      from_planet.setdefault(hw["name"], set())
      from_planet[hw["name"]].add(character["name"])
  from_planet


Ques:20
Create a dictionary character_film_count where the character's name will be the key, and the count of films they appeared in will be the value. There should be no duplicate characters in the dictionary.
Example of expected output:

    ...
}
Ans:
  character_film_count = {}
  for character in dataset:

      if person_films == all_films:
          characters_appeared_in_all_films.append(character['name'])
  characters_appeared_in_all_films


Ques:22
There are some characters who are from the same planet, and we have to consider the planet only once. Create a dictionary planet_characters where the keys will be the planet names and the values will contains
the diameter, population and the list of characters from that planet. The characters list should not contain any duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.
Example of expected output:

              films_producers.setdefault(film["title"], set()).add(producer)


Ques:25
Create two dictionaries male_height_mass and female_height_mass where the keys will be the names of the characters and the values will be the tuple of height and mass of the characters. 
If the height or mass of a character is unknown, take it as 0.
