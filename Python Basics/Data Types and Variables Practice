Ans:
  percentage = 85.5
  converted_percentage = int(percentage)
  result = converted_percentage + 10
  print(result)


Ques:10
Write a Python code to declare a variable student_info and assign it a multi-line string containing the student’s name as Alice, ID is 101, and score is 90.
Print the variable student_info.
Expected outcome:
Name: Alice
ID: 101
Score: 90
Ans:
  student_info = """Name: Alice
  ID: 101
  Score: 90"""
  print(student_info)


Ques:11
Write a Python code to declare two boolean variables attended_classes as True and submitted_assignment as False.
Use the and operator to check if both are True. Store the value in variable result.
Ans:
  attended_classes = True
  submitted_assignment = False
  result = attended_classes and submitted_assignment
  print(result)


Ques:12
Write a Python code to declare a string student_name as Alice.
Store the first character and the last three characters of the string in variables first_char and last_three_chars respectively.
Ans:
  student_name = "Alice"
  first_char = student_name[0]
  last_three_chars = student_name[-3:]
  print(first_char)
  print(last_three_chars)


Ques:13
Write a Python code to reverse the string student_name as Alice and print the reversed name. Store the result in variable reversed_name.
Ans:
  student_name = "Alice"
  reversed_name = student_name[::-1]
  print(reversed_name)


Ques:14
Write a Python code to calculate the sum of the digits of a student’s ID (student_id = 123). Store the result in variable digit_sum.
Do not use loops to solve the problem.
Ans:
  student_id = 123
  digits = str(student_id)
  digit_sum = int(digits[0]) + int(digits[1]) + int(digits[2])
  print(digit_sum)


Ques:15
Write a Python code to calculate the final score of a student by taking their exam_score as 90 and assignment_score as 40.
Multiply the exam_score by 0.6 and the assignment_score by 0.4, then add them together.Store the result in variable final_score.
Ans:
  exam_score = 90
  assignment_score = 40
  final_score = (exam_score * 0.6) + (assignment_score * 0.4)
  print(final_score)
