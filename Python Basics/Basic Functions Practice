Ques:1
Write a function double_number(num) that returns twice the value of num. For example, double_number(5) should return 10.
Ans:
  def double_number(num):
      return num * 2


Ques:2
Write a function sum_and_average(num1, num2) that returns the sum and average of two numbers. For example, sum_and_average(5, 10) should return (15, 7.5). The average should be a floating-point number.
Ans:
  def sum_and_average(num1, num2):
      total = num1 + num2
      average = total / 2
      return total, average


Ques:3
Write the function sum_and_difference(num1, num2) that returns the sum and difference of two numbers. For example, sum_and_difference(5, 10) should return (15, -5).
The function should also have a docstring that describes what it does.
Write the below docstring for the function:
This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum and difference.
Parameters:
- num1: The first number.
- num2: The second number.
Returns:
- A tuple containing the sum and difference of the two numbers.
Expected outcome:
If we check the docstring of the function sum_and_difference using sum_and_difference.__doc__, it should return the above docstring like this:
This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum and difference.
Parameters:
- num1: The first number.
- num2: The second number.
Returns:
- A tuple containing the sum and difference of the two numbers.
Ans:
  def sum_and_difference(num1, num2):
      total = num1 + num2
      difference = num1 - num2
      return total, difference


Ques:4
Define a function is_integer(num) that returnsTrue if the input num is an integer and False otherwise. For example, is_integer(5) should return True, and is_integer(5.5) should return False.
Ans:
  def is_integer(num):
      return isinstance(num, int)


Ques:5
Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius) that returns the Fahrenheit equivalent of the input Celsius temperature. The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = (C * 9/5) + 32.
Ans:
  def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
      return (celsius * 9/5) + 32
